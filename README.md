## Project Title
UPS clone @nkjy
## Project Description
* This project is a clone-like app of an existing app called **UPS**. This app is an admin-oriented solution of how to be able to track all deliveries of a given company for example like **amazon, aliexpress,...**?
* My challenge was to be able to consume all data from **firebase realtime database** using **Graphql API**.
* By the help of **@sonnysangha** i've found a powerful online tool called **Stepzen** that help me easily to manage Graphql API. When you connect to the tool you have a dashboard and you need to install also a sdk on your project.
* So what i've learned is how to use **Graphql API**, manage and create Graphql API with **Stepzen**. How to retrieve **realtime database** data using json link example ...../customer.json, without forgetting **nativewind**, **advanced Typescript best practives**.
* I didn't release a standalone application because the deployment api feature of stepzen is not free and expensive.
## How to Use
* After downloading the app, you will get access of all ongoing deliveries in the first customer navigation tab.
* If you click on one delivery card you'll get all details including location on the map.
* On the orders navigation tab you'll get all orders delivered to the customers. This will ensure that the packages was delivered at the right places or locations.
